# Rock Paper Scissors
Welcome to the aesthetic version of the age old game!
## Features
This simple vanilla JS game features a set of neumorphic buttons, representing each choice the player can make.

The buttons feature active styling of a color change, smoothly transitioning over a given time interval, in order to act as an affordance to the player. In addition, a hover styling makes a button border pulse around the highlighted button over a fixed time interval.

Both the player and computer choices, alongside the results of the game are printed at the top of the page at the end of each round; as an affordance that something has happened, the text is color matched to the outcome - green:win, red:lose, blue:tie.
